# First Normal Form - 1NF 

Hi everybody. We've now learned both how to create tables and how to insert information into those tables. 



In this video we are going to look at a design principle called first normal form or 1NF.

Here we have some information about characters in the Playstation Game Detroit Become Human.



As you can imagine there are many ways we can represent this information in SQL tables. 



For example, suppose we want to encode this character information from the PS4 game Detroit Become Human.

We might encode it as

* all information in one column
* divided into semantic columns
* further divided
* maybe divide it across multiple tables

Some of these methods are better than others.

I think we would all say this is the wrong way to go ... (single column)





A guy named Edgar Codd, one of the big names in databases, came up with some guidelines for how to construct database tables back in 1971. This is called normalization, so database normalization. 

In this video we are going to talk about first normal form or 1NF. 

### a design principle for database tables





There are two rules for 1NF. Here they are

1. Each row of data must contain atomic values
2. Each row of data must have a unique identifier called the primary key

Let's go through each one by one. 



## Atomic values

There are 2 facets to this. One is a hard and fast rule and the other is a wishy washy rule. Kind of where you might say "it depends"



### names 

#### pros for dividing them up

* can personalize communication: "Dear Mr. X" or "Dear Ann"
* might be a requirement of your field (medical - government)
* safer choice - can always go back to single field

#### Cons for dividing up

* Sometimes first and last names insufficient.   Samuel L Jackson 
* Title M.D. PhD  or Junior, or the 3rd. 
* first, last name meaningless -- surname given name
* some Latin American people have 2 last names -- one from each parent
* 

#### pros for single field:

â€‹	easier UI

### Wishy Washy rule. can you break the data down further into parts and does it matter for the current database?

Example 1:

programmers

| Name              | location          |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Ann Mulkern       | Virginia Beach VA |
| Ben Rhodes        | Washington DC     |
| Dr. Matt Carriker | San Antonio TX    |



| firstname | lastname | city           | state |
| --------- | -------- | -------------- | ----- |
| Ann       | Mulkern  | Virginia Beach | VA    |
| Ben       | Rhodes   | Reston         | VA    |
| Matt      | Carriker | San Antonio    | TX    |

The first table we could argue wasn't atomic because we could divide the columns into parts. And the second table, again we could argue, is better. We might want to search by state for example. 

Let's look at a slightly different table



| firstname | lastname | address             | city           | state |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| Ann       | Mulkern  | 1290 Washington Ave | Virginia Beach | VA    |
| Ben       | Rhodes   | 107 Canyon Vista    | Reston         | VA    |
| Matt      | Carriker | 227 FM 207          | San Antonio    | TX    |



we might be tempted to divide that address into the number and street name but for most applications this doesn't matter. At some point you will have to say good enough. and dividing further would be silly. **it's subjective**

Now the hard and fast rule about atomic data.

1. you can't have several values of the same type in a single column
2. you can't have multiple columns with the same type of thing.

an example will clarify this. 



Here is some data we want to represent in a database table



Ann works out of our Boston MA office and knows Python and Javascript

Ben works out of our Boston MA office and knows Golang and Java

Clara works out of our Virginia Beach VA office and knows Python and R.



One way to represent this is 

| programmer | city           | state | languages         |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| Ann        | Boston         | MA    | Python Javascript |
| Ben        | Boston         | MA    | Golang Java       |
| Clara      | Virginia Beach | VA    | Python R          |

This violates condition 1 "A column cannot have several values of the same type in one column"  (not boston boston)

Option 2

| programmer | city           | state | language_one | language_twoJava |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Ann        | Boston         | MA    | Python       | Javascript       |
| Ben        | Boston         | MA    | Golang       | Java             |
| Clara      | Virginia Beach | VA    | Python       | R                |

This violates condition 2 "multiple columns cannot have the same type of data."

Later on we will learn how to design databases that have multiple tables and handle this beautifully. For now we can make this table meet the atomic rule by doing:



| programmer | city           | state | languages  |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Ann        | Boston         | MA    | Python     |
| Ann        | Boston         | MA    | Javascript |
| Ben        | Boston         | MA    | Golang     |
| Ben        | Boston         | MA    | Java       |
| Clara      | Virginia Beach | VA    | Python     |
| Clara      | Virginia Beach | VA    | R          |

This table meets the atomic criteria. 

### first normal form reminder

1. Each row of data must contain atomic values
2. Each row of data must have a unique identifier called the primary key

In this database we don't have a column that contains a unique identifier -- meaning that makes each row unique. Later we will learn other options for primary keys but for now we will make an id column.





| id   | programmer | city           | state | languages  |
| ---- | ---------- | -------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| 1    | Ann        | Boston         | MA    | Python     |
| 2    | Ann        | Boston         | MA    | Javascript |
| 3    | Ben        | Boston         | MA    | Golang     |
| 4    | Ben        | Boston         | MA    | Java       |
| 5    | Clara      | Virginia Beach | VA    | Python     |
| 6    | Clara      | Virginia Beach | VA    | R          |

Now we have a table in 1NF or first normal form.  

**synthetic key**

### declaring a primary key

there are two ways to declare a primary key in SQL



The first is on the line itself



```
CREATE DATABASE library;
\c library

CREATE TABLE books_new
(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  author TEXT NOT NULL,
  title  TEXT NOT NULL,
  acquired DATE
);
```



the second is at the end



```
CREATE TABLE users
(
  id SERIAL,
  name text,
  PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
```



use \d to show the results.

3. learned how to create a database
4. learned how to show all databases and to delete dbs.
5. learned how to create and delete tables.
6. learned the basic data types (text, integer, numeric, date)
7. learned how to insert data into a table. 
8. learned about NULL
9. learned about SERIAL
10. learned about first normal form or 1NF.
11. learned how to declare a column to be the primary key -- must be unique
12. learned how to see the structure of a database table \d
13. learned how to see the entries in a table using SELECT.



### work through an example - 

tee shirt company  -- show off the ranch

bunker branding

stamp   sex, style color size  influencer price, quantity

happy, womens, scoop neck, rose, Medium, Annie Rose, $25.00, 30

Be kind, womens, pocket tee, white, small, Mere Carriker, $19.50, 0

Vet Ranch, unisex, hoodie, blue heather, medium, Vet Ranch, $43.99, 12





**is it in 1NF?**
